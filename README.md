# Banking_App
# Database
Please connect the database to the buttons before debugging, I disconnected them because I had created my own miodules for them to work and I
had to make a turnaround wtih a personal data in order to work with SQFlite, as it is not easy to install on MAC, and I cannot share these personal dara 
on github.
